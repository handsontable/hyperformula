## What is HyperFormula?

HyperFormula is an open-source calculation engine that allows you
to perform Excel-like calculations in your business applications.
HyperFormula is written in TypeScript and works with major
JavaScript frameworks like [Vue](/guide/integration-with-vue.md),
[React](/guide/integration-with-react.md), and Angular. You can use it in a
browser or as a service with Node.js as your back-end technology.

It comes with a built-in [library of functions](/guide/built-in-functions.md)
grouped into different categories, such as Math and trigonometry,
Engineering, Statistical, Financial, and Logical. The functions use
A1 notation and are compatible with popular spreadsheet software like
Excel or Google Sheets, which means that you can easily transfer
the data and formulas between them.

HyperFormula covers most user-triggered actions such as
[CRUD operations](/guide/basic-operations.md), [undo/redo](/guide/undo-redo.md),
and [clipboard operations](/guide/clipboard-operations.md). It also supports
the use of cross-sheet references, [named expressions](/guide/named-ranges.md),
[different data types](/guide/types-of-values.md),
and [custom functions](/guide/custom-functions.md).

## What can it be used for?

HyperFormula doesn't assume any existing user interface \(UI\),
which makes it a great general-purpose library that can be used in
various business applications. Here are some ideas on what you can
build with HyperFormula:

* Smart documents
* Educational apps
* Computation notebooks
* Data grid components
* Business logic builders
* Forms and form builders
* Spreadsheets
* Online calculators
* Low connectivity apps
