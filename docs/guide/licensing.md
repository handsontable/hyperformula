# Licensing

The source code is available under three licenses in order to make it a
better fit for different types of projects.

You are required to specify the license under which you use the
software. This can be done by entering the corresponding keyword or
a generated commercial license key in the
[Configuration Object](configuration-options.md).

## Available licenses

## Open source and non-commercial use
