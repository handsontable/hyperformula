# Built-in functions

## Overview

HyperFormula comes with an extensive library of pre-built functions.
You can use them to create complex formulas for any business application.
Formula syntax and logic of function are similar to what is
considered a standard in modern spreadsheet software. That is
because a spreadsheet is probably the most universal software
ever created. We wanted the same flexibility for HyperFormula
but without the constrains of the spreadsheet UI.

All implemented functions are grouped into 8 different categories:

* Date and time
* Engineering
* Information
* Logical
* Lookup and reference
* Math and trigonometry
* Statistical
* Text

_Some categories such as compatibility, cube, database, and financial
are yet to be supported._

## Language packs

HypeFormula provides translation packs for 16 languages thus making
it easier to create localized applications. The supported languages
are: English (default), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French,
German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian,
Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.

The package includes localization of function names and error values
(such as #REF! or #NAME!). To support more languages or properties
create your own [custom language pack](localizing-functions).

## Custom functions

One of the most valuable features of HyperFormula is its extensibility.
All functions are implemented within the plugin architecture which
means it is easy to remove or replace them. This means you are not
limited by the current functionality of the engine. HyperFormula
lets you design your own [custom functions](custom-functions).
