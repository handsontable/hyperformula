# Sorting data

::: tip
HyperFormula does not support sorting natively.
:::

However, a similar result can be achieved by doing multiple **move**
operations for columns. It works in a similar way to spreadsheet
software like Excel or Google Sheets. That means HyperFormula first
sorts the formulas by their results (values). Then, when the sorting
is done, the formulas are re-calculated with regard to their new
position.
