# Contributing to HyperFormula

Your contributions to this project are very welcome. If you want to fix a bug or propose a new feature, you can open a new Pull Request but first make sure it follows these general rules:

1. Sign this [Contributor License Agreement](https://goo.gl/forms/yuutGuN0RjsikVpM2) to allow us to publish your changes to the code.
2. Make your changes on a separate branch. This will speed up the merging process.
3. Always make the target of your pull request the `develop` branch, not `master`.
4. **Important: For any change you make, please add at least one test case** in `test/e2e/` (for End-to-End tests), `test/unit/` or `src/3rdparty/walkontable/test/spec/`. That will help us understand the issue and make sure that it stays fixed forever. Read more about our [testing process](http://docs.handsontable.com/tutorial-testing.html).
5. Please lint the code.
6. Add a thorough description of all the changes.

Thank you for your commitment!
