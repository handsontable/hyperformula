## Good first issue

Adding a new function will be a huge help for the library growth and
should not be too problematic for the first issue. Extending the
library of translations is also a good task to start with.

Visit [building](building.md) and [testing](testing.md) sections to
get more info about these topics and check the list of commands you
can run in this project. Check the `/i18n`
folder in the project - all translations are kept just right there.
For the functions see the `interpreter/plugin` folder. Both of them
are a good starting point.
