## Good first issue

Adding a new function will be a huge help for the library growth and
should not be too problematic for the first issue. Extending the
library of translations is also a good task to start with.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUskn4ZDDjLGSpO6kg73DOvabNoeqLbkJYyVfLyYlYw)
you can find a list of functions' translations.

Visit [building]( https://handsontable.com/docs/hyperformula/guide/building.html) and [testing]( https://handsontable.com/docs/hyperformula/guide/testing.html) sections to
get more info about these topics and check the list of commands you
can run in this project. Check the `/i18n`
folder in the project - all translations are kept just right there.
For the functions see the `interpreter/plugin` folder. Both of them
are a good starting point.
