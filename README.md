### HyperFormula is an open source, spreadsheet-like calculation engine ⚡

## Description

HyperFormula allows you to perform spreadsheet-like calculations in your
web applications. It is written in TypeScript and supports all major
JavaScript frameworks. You can use it in a browser or as a service with
Node.js as your back-end technology.

The engine comes with a built-in, localized
[library of functions](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/built-in-functions.html)
grouped into different categories, and covers most user-triggered actions
such as [CRUD operations](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/basic-operations.html),
[undo/redo](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/undo-redo.html),
and [clipboard operations](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/clipboard-operations.html).
It also supports the use of cross-sheet references,
[named expressions](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/named-ranges.html),
different [data types](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/types-of-values.html),
and [custom functions](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/custom-functions.html).

## Getting started

Install the library from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperformula):

```js
npm install hyperformula
```

Once properly installed, you can use it like this:

```js
import { HyperFormula } from 'hyperformula';

// define the options
const options = {
  licenseKey: 'agpl-v3',
  precisionRounding: 10
};

// define the data
const data = [['10', '20', '30' '=SUM(A1:C1)']];

// build an instance with defined options and data 
const hfInstance = HyperFormula.buildFromArray(data, options);

// call getCellValue to get the calculation results
const mySum = hfInstance.getCellValue({ col: 3, row: 0, sheet: 0 });

// print the result in the browser's console
console.log(mySum);
```

## What can it be used for?

HyperFormula doesn't assume any existing user interface, which makes it
a great general-purpose library that can be used in various business
applications. Here are some examples:

- Smart documents
- Educational apps
- Computation notebooks
- Data grid components
- Business logic builders
- Forms and form builders
- Spreadsheets
- Online calculators
- Low connectivity apps
