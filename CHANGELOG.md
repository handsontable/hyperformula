## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.0] - 2023-05-29

### Added

- Added a new function: ADDRESS.
  [#1221](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1221)
- Added a new function: HYPERLINK.
  [#1215](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1215)
- Added a new function: IFS.
  [#1157](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1157)

### Changed

- Optimized the `updateConfig()` method to rebuild HyperFormula only when the new configuration is different from the old one.
  [#1251](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1251)

### Fixed

- Fixed the SEARCH function to be case-insensitive regardless of HyperFormula's configuration.
  [#1225](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1225)

## [2.4.0] - 2023-04-24

### Added

- Exported the `CellError` class as a public API.
  [#1232](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1232)
- Exported the `SimpleRangeValue` class as a public API.
  [#1178](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1178)

### Fixed

- Fixed an `EmptyCellVertex` data integrity issue between the `AddressMapping` and `DependencyGraph` objects.
  [#1188](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1188)
- Fixed a build issue with M1- and M2-chip MacBooks.
  [#1166](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1166)

  [#1205](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1205)

## [2.3.1] - 2023-03-03

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where expression names were not allowed to start with a cell
  reference. [#1058](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1058)
- Fixed an issue where expression names were allowed to start with R1C1-notation
  references. For better compatibility with other spreadsheet software, strings
  such as `R4C5`, `RC1000`, `R1C` or `RC` can't be used in expression names
  anymore. [#1058](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1058)

  (`clearSheet()`) could cause an error.
  [#1121](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1121)

  language pack.
  [#1025](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1025)

  [OpenDocument](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/os/part4-formula/OpenDocument-v1.3-os-part4-formula.html#HLOOKUP)
  standard. [#1072](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1072)

  the
  [OpenDocument](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/os/part4-formula/OpenDocument-v1.3-os-part4-formula.html#MATCH)
  standard. [#1063](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1063)

  always rounded to the nearest millisecond (0.001 s).
  [#953](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/953)

### Fixed

- Fixed a rounding issue that caused the TEXT function to incorrectly convert
  dates and times to strings.
  [#1043](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/1043)
- Fixed an issue where functions SUMIF, SUMIFS, COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, and AVERAGEIF
  incorrectly handled complex numeric values.
  [#951](https://github.com/handsontable/hyperformula/issues/951)

### Removed
