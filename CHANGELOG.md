## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2021-09-23

### Changed

- Removed `gpu.js` from optional dependencies and marked config options `gpujs` and `gpuMode` as deprecated.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-08-12

### Changed
- Deprecated the `binarySearchThreshold` configuration option, as every search of sorted data always uses binary search. (#791)

### Added
- Added support for the array arithmetic mode in the `calculateFormula()` method. (#782)
- Added a new `CellType` returned by `getCellType`: `CellType.ARRAYFORMULA`. It's assigned to the top-left corner of an array, and is recognized by the `isCellPartOfArray()` and `doesCellHaveFormula()` methods. (#781)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with searching sorted data. (#787)
- Fixed the `destroy` method to properly destroy HyperFormula instances. (#788)


## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-15

### Changed
- **Breaking change**: Changed API of many sheet-related methods to take sheetId instead of sheetName as an argument. (#645)
- **Breaking change**: Removed support for matrix formulas (`{=FORMULA}`) notation. Engine now supports formulas returning array of values (instead of only scalars). (#652)
- **Breaking change**: Removed numeric matrix detection along with matrixDetection and matrixDetectionThreshold config options. (#669)
- **Breaking change**: Changed API of the following methods to take `SimpleCellRange` type argument: `copy`,  `cut`, `getCellDependents`, `getCellPrecedents`, `getFillRangeData`, `getRangeFormulas`,  `getRangeSerialized`, `getRangeValues`, `isItPossibleToMoveCells`, `isItPossibleToSetCellContents`, `moveCells`. (#687)
- **Breaking change**: Changed the AGPLv3 license to GPLv3.
- **Breaking change**: Removed the free non-commercial license.
- **Breaking change**: Changed behaviour of `setCellContents` so that it is possible to override space occupied by spilled array. (#708)
- **Breaking change**: Changed behaviour of `addRows/removeRows` so that it is possible to add/remove rows across spilled array without changing array size. (#708)
- **Breaking change**: Changed behaviour of `addColumns/removeColumns` so that it is possible to add/remove columns across spilled array without changing array size. (#732)
- **Breaking change**: Changed config options (#747):

| before                | after                |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| matrixColumnSeparator | arrayColumnSeparator |
| matrixRowSeparator    | arrayRowSeparator    |

- **Breaking change**: Changed CellType.MATRIX to CellType.ARRAY (#747)
- **Breaking change**: Changed API methods (#747):

| before             | after             |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| matrixMapping      | arrrayMapping     |
| isCellPartOfMatrix | isCellPartOfArray |

- **Breaking change**: Changed Exceptions (#747):

| before                       | after                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| SourceLocationHasMatrixError | SourceLocationHasArrayError |
| TargetLocationHasMatrixError | TargetLocationHasArrayError |
